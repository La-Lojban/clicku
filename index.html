        <big>lo lojbo panci</big>
        <span class="tl">Lojban Smells<span>
    </h1>

    <h4>Pronouns</h4>

    <p>Lojban has two types of root words, <em>cmavo (shma-vo)</em> and <em>gismu (gees-moo)</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Cmavo are used to form the structure of Lojban sentences. They are between two and four letters long, and may include apostrophes. They are used for things like pronouns.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi
            <span class="tl">me</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            do
            <span class="tl">you</span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Gismu are used to form the content of Lojban sentences. They are five letters long, and are used for things like verbs.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            tavla
            <span class="tl">talk to</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            klama
            <span class="tl">come to</span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Lojban sentences have two major components: The arguments, and the predicate. Lojban statements use a predicate to describe a relationship between some arguments. In a simple Lojban statement, the arguments are made of cmavo, and the predicate is made of gismu.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi klama do
            <span class="tl">I come to you<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Predicates can consist of multiple gismu. The relationship between the arguments is described by the last gismu in the predicate. The former gismu modify the latter.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi sutra klama do
            <span class="tl">I swiftly come to you<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

            <td>mi</td>
            <td class="tl">speaker</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>do</td>

        </tr>
        <tr/ class="list-break">
        <tr>
            <td>mi'a</td>
            <td class="tl">speaker and listener</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>mi'o</td>
            <td class="tl">speaker and other</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>do'o</td>
            <td class="tl">listener and other</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ma'a</td>
            <td class="tl">speaker, listener and other</td>
        </tr>
        <tr/ class="list-break">
        <tr>
            <td>ti</td>
            <td class="tl">this here</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ta</td>
            <td class="tl">that there</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>tu</td>
            <td class="tl">that yonder</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Descriptors</h4>

    <p>By using the cmavo <em>lo</em>, we can construct an argument using gismu. The cmavo <em>lo</em> means "that which does this verb."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi sutra klama lo tavla
            <span class="tl">I switfly come to that which talks<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To avoid ambiguity, when the first argument is constructed using gismu, we put the cmavo <em>cu (shoo)</em> before the predicate.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            lo sutra tavla cu klama mi 
            <span class="tl">That which swiftly talks does come to me<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To describe a noun by what it is called instead of what it does, we can use the cmavo <em>la</em>. In Lojban, names are surrounded by the pause symbol, the period.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            la .alis. tavla mi 
            <span class="tl">Alice talks to me<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We can also construct arguments using cmavo and gismu together.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            lo mi karce cu sutra 
            <span class="tl">My car is swift<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The cmavo <em>loi</em> and <em>lai</em> are used to refer to a kind rather than a thing iteslf.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            loi bakni cu mabru 
            <span class="tl">Bovines are mammals<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The cmavo <em>lo'i</em> and <em>la'i</em> are used to refer to a set itself, rather than its members.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            lo'i cenre cu barda 
            <span class="tl">The amount of sand is big<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We can use the cmavo <em>zo</em> to refer to a word itself, instead of it's meaning.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            zo rirxe cu nandu bacru
            <span class="tl">The word "river" is hard to utter<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If we need to quote multiple words in a row, we can use the cmavo <em>lu</em> to begin a quote, and <em>li'u</em> to end it.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            do cusku lu tavla mi li'u
            <span class="tl">You say "talk to me!"<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>lo</td>
            <td class="tl">that which does</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>la</td>
            <td class="tl">that which is called</td>
        </tr>
        <tr/ class="list-break">
        <tr>
            <td>loi</td>
            <td class="tl">the mass of that which does</td>

        <tr>

            <td class="tl">the set of that which is called</td>
        </tr>
        <tr/ class="list-break">

        <tr>
            <td>lu</td>
            <td class="tl">that which is the words</td>
        </tr>
        <tr/ class="list-break">
        <tr>
            <td>cu</td>
            <td class="tl">begin predicate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>li'u</td>
            <td class="tl">terminate lu</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Numbers</h4>

    <p>In addition to gismu, we can sometimes place cmavo at the beginning of a predicate to modify its meaning.</p>

    <p>Lojban has no default plurality. To express plurality, we begin a predicate with a number cmavo, such as <em>re</em>, meaning "two."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            ta re badna
            <span class="tl">That is two bananas<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To express plurality the same way we would in English, we can preface <em>re</em> with the cmavo <em>su'o (soo-ho)</em>, meaning "at least."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            ta su'o re badna
            <span class="tl">That is at least two bananas<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Temporal Tense</h4>

    <p>As with plurality, Lojban has no default tense. We can preface a predicate with the cmavo <em>pu (poo)</em> to express that something occured in the past.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi pu sipna
            <span class="tl">I slept<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In addition to direction, we can use modifiers like <em>zu (zoo)</em> to suggest temporal distance.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            lo terdi pu zu cfari
            <span class="tl">The Earth, long ago, was created<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We can use event contours like <em>ca'o (sha-ho)</em> to express aspect in the same way as English words like "already" and "still."

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            tu ca'o bajra 
            <span class="tl">He continues to run<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Spatial Tense</h4>

    <p>In addition to temporal distance, Lojban uses cmavo to express spatial distance. The cmavo <em>vu (voo)</em> means "that which is far away."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            do klama vu 
            <span class="tl">You come to something far away<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There are also cmavo to express directionality.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            tu ri'u bajra
            <span class="tl">She rightwardly runs<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Interjections</h4>

    <p>Indicators are a type of cmavo used to describe a statement itself. They occur at the beginning of a statement.</p>

    <p>The indicator <em>xu (khoo)</em> is used to indicate that a statement is a yes or no question.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            xu do tavla mi 
            <span class="tl">Is it true that you talk to me?<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Attitudinals are used to indicate the emotion around a statement. The attitudinal <em>ui (ooee)</em> is used to indicate that a statement is happy.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            ui mi dansu 
            <span class="tl">It's happy that I dance<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Evidentials are used to indicate how a statement is know. The evidential <em>ti'e (tee-heh)</em> is used to indicate that a statement is known by hearsay.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            ti'e do nelci lo cakla 
            <span class="tl">I hear you like chocolate<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Vocatives are indicators used to address a listener directly, although the listener may or may not be specified.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            coi la .alis.
            <span class="tl">Hello, Alice<span>
        </p>

        <p>
            pe'u mi troci 
            <span class="tl">Please, may I try?<span>
        </p>

        <p>
            ki'e
            <span class="tl">Thank you<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Order</h4>

    <p>Gismu may define a relationship between up to five arguments. The order or the arguments is a vital part of a gismu's definition.<p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi klama la .bastn. la .nuiork.
            <span class="tl">I come to Boston from New York<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If we want to invert the relationship of the first two arguments in a statement, we can use a conversion cmavo at the beginning of a predicate, such as <em>se</em>, which switches the first and second arguments.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            la .bastn. se klama mi la .nuiork.
            <span class="tl">Boston is come to by me from New York<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To skip over an argument and discuss the later argument, we can use a tagging cmavo, like <em>fi (fee)</em>, which skips to the third argument.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi klama fi la .nuiork.
            <span class="tl">I come from New York<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Logic</h4>

    <p>To state that two arguments do not have a relationship, we can put the cmavo <em>na</em> before a gismu in the predicate.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi na tavla la .alis.
            <span class="tl">I don't talk to Alice<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We can use logical connectives to suggest a set of possibilites. cmavo like <em>.a</em> express that either or both parts of an argument may apply.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            do .a mi klama lo skina
            <span class="tl">You, I, or both of us come to the cinema<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Lojban uses different words for sentence separation depending on the relationship between the sentences being separated. The cmavo <em>.i</em> separates sentences which have no relationship, like the period in English.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi nelci lo ladru .i do nelci lo cakla
            <span class="tl">I like milk. You like chocolate<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We can use the cmavo <em>.ija (ee-sia)</em> to express that either or both sentences are true.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi nelci lo ladru .ija do nelci lo cakla
            <span class="tl">I like milk, you like chocolate, or both.<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Abstractors</h4>

    <p>Sometimes we want to treat an entire statement as if it were a noun. To do this, we preface it with an abstractor, such as the event abstractor cmavo, <em>nu (noo)</em>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi djica lo nu mi sipna
            <span class="tl">I desire that which is the event of "I sleep"<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If we need to use an abstractor in the middle of a statement, we can use the cmavo <em>kei (keii)</em> to close it.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi klama lo nu mi tavla do kei lo karce
            <span class="tl">I come to that which is the event of "I talk to you" from the car<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Modals</h4>

    <p>Sometimes we need to attach extra information to a statement when there is no place in the gismu definition for the information to go. For this, we can use modals at the end of a statement.<p>

    <p>We can use the cmavo <em>fi'o (fee-ho)</em> to express what we are going to describe, and <em>fe'u (fe-hoo)</em> to describe it. If we want to express that we are talking in sign language, we might say that we are going to describe what we employ, and that it is hands.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi tavla do fi'o pilno fe'u xanse
            <span class="tl">I talk to you, employing: hands<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There exist shorthand words for commonly used modals, such as <em>pi'o (pee-ho)</em> for <em>pilno</em>, meaning "employing."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi tavla do pi'o xanse
            <span class="tl">I talk to you using hands<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Some of the most common modals are used to describe the reason for things happening, such as <em>ki'u (kee-hoo)</em>, meaning "physically caused by."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            mi na klama ki'u snime
            <span class="tl">I do not come, because snow<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Another common use for modals is to describe likelihood and possibility.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            xu do ka'e tavla fo lo lojbo bangu
            <span class="tl">Can you talk in the lojbanic language?<span>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
